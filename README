This is a connect4 program in python. 
   When executing the code please use:
         ./p4_main.py -l <row goes here> -w <column goes here> -d <win length goes here>
   All these values are not necessary, however, if you do not input them, they will result to default
   values, which all are equal to 3.

   There are also additional commands during the gameplay. These are the save, load and quit commands.
         save ==> -s <filename>
         load ==> -l <filename>
         quit ==> -q 

   Please keep in mind any strings other than the above entered will not work (unless I missed some).
   The quit command may also prompt you with yes or no depending on whether you want to quit or not,
   if you type in anything other than yes, it will go back to the game.

I didn't really know how commenting on python would work, so on this particular project, there is no comments on any codings, but these are very similar to the ones I have done previously on C programming. 

UPDATE:
  there is also a new package called p4_mainG.py which includes the GUI with it. It uses pyqt4 and imports from testGUI.py, which is the
  'engine' for the GUI. It has load and save functionality as well. You are able to use both the command line, by typing in the normal
  above commands, or use the below command for gui.
 
  to use this, you will need to type in:
     ./p4_mainG.py -g

  you can also load from a file from the command line, however, this technique will only work on the non GUI part.
