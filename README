This is a connect4 program in python. 
   When executing the code please use:
         ./p4_main -l <row goes here> -w <column goes here> -d <win length goes here>

   There are also additional commands during the gameplay. These are the save, load and quit commands.
         save ==> -s <filename>
         load ==> -l <filename>
         quit ==> -q 

   Please keep in mind any strings other than the above entered will not work (unless I missed some).
   The quit command may also prompt you with yes or no depending on whether you want to quit or not,
   if you type in anything other than yes, it will go back to the game.

I didn't really know how commenting on python would work, so on this particular project, there is no comments on any codings, but these are very similar to the ones I have done previously on C programming.
